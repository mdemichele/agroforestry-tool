Agroforestry Tool For Designing Perennial Systems

# Goal of the Project
The first goal would be to make a suite of command line tools that would be helpful for either agroforestry design or small-scale farming. The point of it being a command line tool would be to make it as simple as possible to get the needed information. Farmers are busy. This helps them get exactly the answers they need and nothing else. We can make this a no-nonesense data machine. Saves time. Part of the goal might be to make the usage of the command line the least daunting possible for someone who might not have ever used the command line before.
